```{r setup}
#| include: FALSE
require(geomorph)
```

## The goal

We would like to establish a set of landmarks that can be applied to *Tripodellus*. It doesn't have a lot of homologous points so Type I landmarks are limited:

![Tripodellus from sample Ko213](Trip1_ko213.jpg){fig-alt="top view"}

Instead, we probably need to use sliding landmarks to capture the curvature of the element outline.

## Geomorph

This package does not provide options for importing the outline of an image into xy coordinates, but allows interactive selection of Type I landmarks. So we can directly digitize the figure above, but only a few points on it can be objectively distinguished as homologous. Here I used 5. I only show you the code but it is not executed, hence `eval: FALSE`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
geomorph::digitize2d(
  filelist="Trip1_ko213.jpg",
  nlandmarks=15,
  scale = NULL,
  tpsfile="top15.tps",
  MultScale = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

The landmarks are saved into `top.tps`. It can be read back into R using:

```{r}
#| label: 5landmarks
top <- readland.tps(file="top.tps")
plot(x = top[,1,1],
     y = top[,2,1], 
     pch = 16)
```

That really isn't a lot to go by. 

## Sliding landmarks in geomorph

Here I digitize 12 landmarks, of which 5 are Type I.

```{r digitize 12 landmarks to produce some sliders}
#| eval: false
ko <- list.files(pattern = "*.jpg")

geomorph::digitize2d(
  filelist=ko,
  nlandmarks=12,
  scale = NULL,
  tpsfile="top15.tps",
  MultScale = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

How to make the remaining ones sliding landmarks?

```{r}
top12 <- readland.tps(file="top15.tps")
plot(x = top12[,1,1],
     y = top12[,2,1], 
     pch = 16)
```

```{r make a list of sliders}
#| eval: false
define.sliders(landmarks = top12, 
               nsliders = 7, 
               write.file = TRUE)
```

After some clicking in interactive mode, which cannot be shown in Quarto and needs to be done directly in R, a file called `curveslide.csv` is saved and can be used in future analyses. Now we can digitize two more specimens. Important is to always use the same number of landmarks and place them in the same order.

# Actual analysis: Procrustes

```{r}
top.gpa<-gpagen(top12)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
top.gpa$links <- define.links(top.gpa$coords[,,1])
```

```{r}
plotAllSpecimens(top.gpa$coords,
                 links = top.gpa$links)
```

```{r}
top.PCA <- gm.prcomp(top.gpa$coords)
plot(top.PCA, 
     main = "PCA top view")
text(top.PCA$x[,1], 
     top.PCA$x[,2], 
     labels = c("Trip1_ko213", "Trip1_ko214", "Trip2_ko214"),
     offset = 0.6,
     pos = 3)
```
